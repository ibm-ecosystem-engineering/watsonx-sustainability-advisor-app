# Watsonx Sustainability Advisor App

The Sustainability Reporting Manager in IBM Envizi spends a lot of time in preparing the responses to the various questions from the disclosure reports.

We leveraged the generative AI capability of watsonx.ai to create the Watsonx Sustainability Advisor, a tool that serves as a dynamic guide to respond to any given reporting framework question.

Watson-x Sustainability Advisor can help the sustainability reporting manager to get the responses to the various questions very quickly.

It leverages watsonx Assistant to get the questions from the sustainability reporting manager.

For the given question, the Watson Assistant send this question to Watson Discovery, which does a semantic search by scanning through various sustainability reports and retrieves the relevant document passages back to the Watson Assistant.

Then watson Assistant sends the question along with the document passages that are retrieved by the Watson Discovery as an instruction to Watsonx.ai

Watsonx.ai reads the prompt and uses the LLM model to summarize the answer for the question back to the watson Assistant. 

The watson Assistant shows the summary response to the user as an answer to their question.

## 1. Source code details

### 1.1 Watson Assistant UI and API

<img src="images/advisor-wa.png">

The `app` folder of this repo contains the python app code, which uses Watson Discovery, and Watsonx.ai  to respond to the queries from the UI.

The `web-wa` folder contains the `ReactJS UI` code and it opens up the `Watson-Assistant` in the screen. Then the Watson-Assistant would calls Watson Discovery, and Watsonx.ai  to respond to the queries of the user.

#### Solution Architecture

This solution follows RAG architecture model.  The tech stacks used here are the following
- Watsonx.ai
- Watson Assistant
- Watson Discovery
- LangChain
