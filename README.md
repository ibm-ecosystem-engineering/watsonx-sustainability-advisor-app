# Watsonx Sustainbility Advisor App

The Sustainability Reporting Manager in IBM Envizi spends a lot of time in preparing the responses to the various questions from the disclosure reports.

Watson-x Sustainability Advisor can help the sustainability reporting manager to get the responses to the various questions very quickly.

It leverages watsonx Assistant to take the questions from the sustainability reporting manager.

For the given question, the Watsonx Assistant gets the relevant text passages from the Watson Discovery that contains the various reports and informations loaded from the Envizi.

Once the passages are retrieved from the Watson discovery, this watsonx Assistant pass the passes to Watsonx.ai to make a summary out of it.

The summary response is shown to the user as an answer to their question.

## 1. Source code details

### 1.1 Watson Assistant UI and API

<img src="images/advisor-wa.png">

The `app` folder of this repo contains the python app code, which uses Watson Discovery, and Watsonx.ai  to respond to the queries from the UI.

The `web-wa` folder contains the `ReactJS UI` code and it opens up the `Watson-Assistant` in the screen. Then the Watson-Assistant would calls Watson Discovery, and Watsonx.ai  to respond to the queries of the user.
