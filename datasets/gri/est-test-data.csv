Custom,What is the product packaging methdology followed,"IBM has had a program focused on the environmental attributes of its product packaging since the late 1980s. A key priority is to design products which can be shipped with a minimum amount of packaging materials. Beyond that, whenever possible, we choose packaging materials that have the least adverse impact on the environment, collaborating with suppliers to use recycled and recyclable materials and to promote reuse. Our corporate environmental requirements for product packaging are embedded in various engineering specifications and procurement documents, which extend their reach beyond IBM to include our supply chain and other business partners. All product packaging suppliers that pack or ship products to customers on behalf of IBM worldwide must submit packaging environmental data to IBM, along with other relevant compliance and performance data. Suppliers that do not conform to an IBM specification or other requirement must submit and implement improvement plans to close out the identified issues within an agreed timeframe"

GRI 301-3,How IBM collects the data regarding Reclaimed products and their packaging materials ?,"As part of its product end-of-life management (PELM) activities, IBM began offering product takeback programs for clients in Europe in 1989 and has extended and enhanced these activities over the years. When assets cannot be directly reused, they are remanufactured or refurbished using rigorous processes and original manufacturing standards. Parts are harvested for reutilization, as well as sold externally. These practices extend the life of IT equipment and reduce the need to manufacture new products. After all reuse and remarketing opportunities are exhausted, remaining components are sent for materials recovery and recycling. In 2021, IBM processed more than 18,000 metric tons (MT) of end-of-life products and product waste, with 97.7% (by weight) reused, resold, or sent for recycling, 2.0% sent to waste-to- energy for final disposition, and 0.3% sent to landfills or for incineration. Processed end-of-life products and product waste includes equipment returned from clients as well equipment used internally within IBM, and includes both IBM logo products as well as third-party products. IBM does not report on the percentage of its hardware products that are returned to IBM for recycling. Enterprise IT equipment, such as that manufactured and sold by IBM, is readily reused and recycled by third-party recyclers, and while IBM offers such services to its clients, many prefer to use their own suppliers for recycling of their IT equipment."
