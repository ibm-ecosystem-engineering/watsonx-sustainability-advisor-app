    "Determining Scope 3 <em>emissions</em> across a company\u2019s value chain can be extremely challenging due to a lack of access to primary source data across multiple entities.\nNevertheless, we report Scope 3 GHG <em>emissions</em> in five of the fifteen categories defined by the GHG Protocol's Corporate Value Chain <em>Emissions</em> Accounting and Reporting standard. IBM calculates certain Scope 3 <em>emissions</em> related to the \u201cPurchased Goods and Services\" category \u2014 namely, <em>emissions</em> associated with electricity IBM consumes in third-party operated spaces that IBM leases for data center operations (referred to as co-location data centers), and we furthermore approximate <em>emissions</em> in four other Scope 3 categories. These approximations represent Scope 3 <em>emissions</em> pertaining to areas for which we have some relevant information upon which to make assumptions.\nThat said, IBM believes real reductions of <em>emissions</em> are directly and demonstrably achieved when the organization generating the <em>emission</em> takes action to do so. That\u2019s why we are committed to achieve net-zero operational GHG <em>emissions</em> by 2030.

Building upon these requirements, in April 2021, IBM enhanced its supplier engagement by establishing a new goal requiring key suppliers in <em>emissions</em>-intensive business sectors to set a goal to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 <em>emissions</em> that is aligned with scientific recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to limit Earth's warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.",
